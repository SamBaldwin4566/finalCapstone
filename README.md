# Capstone Project - Build a Complete Website
While studying in my Web Development Bootcamp I was given the task to build a complete working website using Javascript, HTML and CSS. I was given the freedom to make it about any subject. I chose to create a recipe website for Tacos. I feel this was the kind of website I could make to utilise all the different skills I have gained throughout the bootcamp. There were certain specifications I had to follow; The style had to include various different fonts and styles using CSS. I had to include a table and lists, links, images and forms. 
After creating the base website without any functionality I was given the task to use JavaScript to create a "save for later" page. Using the session storage images/recipes/articles had to be able to be saved onto another page to be viewed later. I made this a "My account" page where the user can subscribe and save the contents over to a new HTML.

When you click an image a prompt box will appear asking if you would like to save the image for later and then let you know how many images/recipes you have saved to your account<br><br>
<img src="./Images/Screenshot3.png" width="45%">|<img src="./Images/Screenshot4.png" width="45%"><br><br>

The form at the bottom of the page allows you to 'subscirbe' and create an account.<br><br>

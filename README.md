# Capstone Project - Build a Complete Website
While studying in my Web Development Bootcamp I was given the task to build a complete working website using Javascript, HTML and CSS. I was given the freedom to make it about any subject. I chose to create a recipe website for Tacos. I feel this was the kind of website I could make to utilise all the different skills I have gained throughout the boocamp. There were certain specifications I had to follow; The style had to include various different fonts and styles. I had to include a table and lists, links, images and forms. After creating the base website without any functionality I was given the task to use Javascript to create a "save for later" page. Using the session storage images/recipes/articles had to be able to be saved onto another page to be viewed later. I made this a "My account" page where the user can subscribe and save the contents over to a new HTML.
